In order to communicate with the outside world, we use three IPs: VGA, UART and Keyboard.  

The VGA IP is used to display information like on the screen, the UART IP is used to communicate with the computer and the Keyboard IP is used to get the input from the keyboard.       

In that chapter we are going to describe how we used those IPs in our project and their functionalities.
