In order to communicate with the outside world, we use three IPs: VGA, UART and Keyboard.  

The VGA IP is used to display information like on the screen, the UART IP is used to communicate with the fpga and the Keyboard IP is used to get the input from the keyboard.       

In that chapter we are going to briefly explain how those IPs works and how to use them in our project.
