HAS - super minimaly
MAS - all the blocks, tq blocks, tq entry blocks, pipe_wrap, pipe, d_cache, 
Verification
    -refModel: on what we are doing monitoring
    -Dedicated test: list of test we did, to check what, (specific features, same CL, diff CL)
    -Checkers: compare our DUT to refModel, PostProcess
    -Trackers: what trackers we have on pipe, on TQ


mux to pipe, who can go through
