## Quartus
Quartus is a software suite developed by Intel (formerly Altera) that is used for designing, programming, and configuring Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)   

 - Design Environment: Quartus provides a comprehensive environment for designing these custom logic circuits. It includes tools for creating and simulating your digital designs, as well as tools for synthesizing and compiling your designs into a format that can be loaded onto the FPGA.

- Hardware Description Language (HDL): Quartus works with hardware description languages like VHDL and Verilog, which allow engineers to describe the behavior of their digital circuits. These descriptions are then used to generate the configuration files needed to program the FPGA.

- Programming and Configuration: Once your design is complete, Quartus helps you generate the bitstream or configuration file that can be loaded onto the target FPGA. This file tells the hardware how to configure itself to implement your custom logic.

- Integration with FPGA Boards: Quartus is often used in conjunction with specific FPGA development boards, which provide the physical hardware for testing and running your custom designs.
