## VS Code
VS Code is a versatile and powerful code editor that can help you write and debug code more efficiently. Here are some reasons why VS Code is a good editor for our project:  
- Accessible Command Line: VS Code provides an integrated terminal that allows you to run command-line tools directly from the editor. This includes tools like Git Bash, which can be useful for version control and other tasks.  
- SystemVerilog Extensions: VS Code has extensions that provide syntax highlighting and autocompletion for SystemVerilog, which can make it easier to write and read SystemVerilog code.  
- C Extensions and Other Tools: VS Code also supports C/C++ development and provides a range of tools for debugging, profiling, and testing. This includes features like the C/C++ extension, the Debugger for C/C++, and the C/C++ TestMate extension. It also has tools like the linker to link object files.  
- GitHub Copilot: VS Code now comes with an AI-powered code assistant called GitHub Copilot, which can suggest code snippets and even write code for you. While still in beta, Copilot can be a great productivity booster for repetitive tasks.  
- View Diagrams and Pictures: VS Code has a built-in viewer for diagrams and pictures, which can be useful for viewing block diagrams, waveforms, or other graphical representations of your project.  
- Read PDF: VS Code also has a built-in PDF viewer that allows you to read and annotate PDF files directly in the editor.  
- Git Version Control Extensions: VS Code has many extensions that can help you work with Git and other version control systems. This includes the built-in Git integration as well as popular extensions like GitLens and Git History.  

By using VS Code as your development environment, you can benefit from its many features and extensions, which can make it easier to write, debug, and manage your code.
