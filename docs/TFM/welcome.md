# TFM - Tools, Flows & Methodologies

Here we will describe the Tools, Flows & methodologies (TFM) of this project.  
We strongly recommend that you have a solid understanding of the foundational topics outlined in the TFM section.

Please make sure to follow the subjects in the left side bar and install the necessary software. Keep in mind that some topics are mandatory, such as software installation, while others provide additional information that may be useful in the future.

Feel free to contact us through the [Contact Us](/docs/contact_us/contact.md) page if you have any questions.


## The MAFIA project TFM  
The MAFIA project is a multi disciplinary project that requires understanding of many topics.  
- HW logic design
- Embedded SW development
- Automation
- Version Control
- Project Management
- CI/CD

There are many different tools and methodologies that can be used to develop a project like this. 
In this TFM chapter we will describe the tools and methodologies that we have chosen to use in this project.  
**We will try and keep the TFM section as a stand alone section that can be used for any project, and not necessarily for the MAFIA project.  


## List of tools and links we use:
*We are running all the tools on windows without WSL*
