Welcome! If you've reached this point, congratulations on a job well done. In this section, we'll learn the process of implementing Mafia cores on the FPGA DE10 Lite.   
We assume you might know a bit about FPGAs and the tools we're using, but if not, don't stress about it. You can always [contact us](docs/contact_us/contact.md), or click the [here](/docs/TFM/projectTool/quartus_intro.md) and read that section.
