Micro-Architecture Specification (MAS) for Arbiter Module
# 1. Overview
Brief Description:
This document details the micro-architecture of an Arbiter module designed to manage multiple client requests and select a winner based on a predefined arbitration scheme.

Purpose and Functionality:
The Arbiter module is used to arbitrate among NUM_CLIENTS clients. It determines which client gains access based on the input signals.

Signal Descriptions:

| Signal Name      | Direction | Description                                 |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| clk              | Input     | Clock signal.                               |
| rst              | Input     | Reset signal.                               |
| valid_candidate  | Input     | Array indicating valid candidates.          |
| winner_dec_id    | Output    | Decision array indicating the winner.       |

# 4. Functional Description
Operational Modes:

The module arbitrates among NUM_CLIENTS clients.
It uses the valid_candidate array to determine which clients are currently requesting access.
Data Flow Description:

The arbiter prioritizes clients based on a fixed scheme.
Upon determining a winner, the winner_dec_id signal is asserted corresponding to the winning client.
# 5. Configuration and Control
Configuration Registers:

NUM_CLIENTS: Defines the number of clients participating in arbitration.
# 6. Performance and Characteristics
Throughput:
Dependent on the clock frequency.

Latency:
Typically one clock cycle for arbitration decision.

# 7. Error Handling and Exceptions
The module does not explicitly include error handling mechanisms in the provided RTL. Design-specific error handling should be considered.
# 8. Testing and Verification
Test Plan Overview:

Verify correct arbitration among multiple clients.
Test for edge cases where multiple clients request access simultaneously.
Verification Strategies:

Simulate with varying numbers of clients.
Stress test with simultaneous requests.
