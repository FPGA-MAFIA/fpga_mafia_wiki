# Build GUI

In general we recommend working directly from the command line without gui.
But, to learn and ease the process of the writing and running commands, we have created a GUI.

This will allow to use drop down menus, and see what are the available options, flags, arguments, tests and more.

To run the build gui:  
```./gui_build.py ```
This will open an interactive GUI that will allow you to build and run commands.
