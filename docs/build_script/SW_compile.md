# SW Compilation
In this section we will write a basic C program and compile the software part of the project. 

- Go to `verif/mini_core/tests` and create file named `basics.c` with the following content:
```
int main(){
    int x = 1;
    int y = 2;

    int z = x + y;

    return 0;
}
```
- Type the following command in the terminal to compile the C program we just wrote:
```
./build.py -dut mini_core -test basics -app
```

- Go to `target/mini_core/tests/basics` and observe the content of the folder. You should see the following files:

![basics_sw_compile.png](/snapshots/basics_sw_compile.png)

WOW we got all the files we need to run the HW simulation. Let's try to understand what each file is doing: (those are the most important files)

 - `basics_rv32i.c.s` - This is an assembly file that was generated by the compiler. This file contains the assembly code of the C program we wrote.

- `basics_rv32i.elf` - This is an ELF file that was generated by the compiler. This file contains the machine code of the C program we wrote. This file is not readable by humans so we wont use it at this point.

 - `basics_rv32i_elf.txe` - This is the converted version of the ELF file written in assembly code. This file is readable and we will use it allot while running and debugging the HW simulation.

 - `inst_mem.sv` - This is the instruction memory file that contains the machine code of the C program we wrote suitable for    
 RISC-V ISA. 

 note: Please download the [riscv-spec](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf) cause you will need it in the future.
 Please make sure you understand `RV32I Base Instruction Set` as shown in chapter 19 and `RISC-V Assembly Programmerâ€™s Handbook` as shown in chapter 20 cause we will use the following table in the future:
